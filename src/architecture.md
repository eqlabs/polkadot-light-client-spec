# Architecture & artifacts

A light client should support multiple platforms to improve the security of wallets on mobile devices/web/desktop. So from architectural point of view itâ€™s important to have the following:

- Cross-platform C++ library that can be built against desktop and mobile platforms
- Native desktop console application (linux)
- WebAssembly module with a JS wrapper that can be used in browser
- Inline and standalone documentation

Since WASM module is to be used in a browser, it will be able to call RPC methods via API, not via RPC server.
