# Goal

This project is to create a C++ equivalent of [substrate-connect](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-substrate) light client. This would:

- Improve light client specification
- Involve C++ community into Polkadot development
- Add more integration options for mobile and desktop platforms
